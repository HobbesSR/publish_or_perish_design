The rules for Publish or Perish can be found in "Publish or Perish Rules (1.0).pdf"

Cards in Publish or Perish are double sided, with dinosaur faces and habitat faces. Files have been included for print and play and for import as a custom deck in Tabletop Simulator. In each case there are options to have the habitat cards with full card AI generated paleo art to illustrate the vision of the artistic style. This art is not necessary for play.

Print and Play instructions:
Cards have numbers in the lower right corner that can be used to pair the fronts and backs of each card.
PoP_duplex_pnp.pdf can be printed in duplex mode on printer for double sided cards.
PoP_habitat_cards_with_art.pdf can be used to print single sided cards to be paired with the dinosaur pages in PoP_duplex_pnp.pdf
